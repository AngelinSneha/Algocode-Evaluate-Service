- This Project Integrates **Redis** Message Blocker which helps in handling all the submissions made by [Algocode-Problem-Solving](https://github.com/AngelinSneha/AlgoCode-problem-solving) Service.
- Each Code Submission is added inside the **Message Queue** and these jobs would be proccessed one by one based on priority.
- Each Code Submission runs in a Docker Container.
- Using streams we read the code from the Container and then proccess the data.
